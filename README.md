# TODOs

## Diffs

- [ ] Change my own tag
- [ ] Kill components (tag change or child removed)
- [ ] Can props be components?

- [ ] Inline elements / spans
- [ ] Re-render asynchronously; batch state changes
- [ ] Run all effects after the first render
- [ ] More widgets
- [ ] `use_context` hook
- [ ] use custom classes for states, effects, might make setters more performant
- [ ] Support `ref=` prop
