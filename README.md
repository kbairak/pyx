# TODOs

## Diffs

- [ ] Change my own tag
- [ ] Can props be components (recursive search for elements/components)?

- [ ] Inline elements / spans
- [ ] Re-render asynchronously; batch state changes
- [ ] Run all effects **after** the first render
- [ ] More widgets
- [ ] `use_context` hook
- [ ] Support `ref=` prop
- [ ] (?) use custom classes for states, effects, might make setters more performant
