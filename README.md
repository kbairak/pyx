# TODOs

## Diffs

- [ ] Change my own tag
- [ ] Can props be components (recursive search for elements/components)?
  - [ ] Treat children as prop, like react does?

## Other

- [ ] More widgets
  - [x] panels
  - [x] columns
  - [ ] tree
  - [ ] layout
  - [ ] tables
  - [ ] syntax
- [ ] Inline elements / spans
- [ ] `use_context` hook
- [ ] Support `ref=` prop
- [ ] (?) use custom classes for states, effects, might make setters more performant
- [ ] Inputs
